## repository structure
This is the proposed structure. Note that some of these folders may be empty:

 * [docs](./docs) &mdash; the place for seperate documentation, if needed (*empty*)
 * [scripts](./scripts) &mdash; scripts (Node.js, mostly) for supporting the development, testing, and deployment of Solidity code. To date, all of these scripts are hardhat-centric.
 * [libraries](./libraries) &mdash; Solidity library code (*empty*)
 * [contracts](./contracts) &mdash; Solidity smart contracts (*empty*)
